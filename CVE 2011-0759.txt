Security Advisory

Issue Description
The WordPress Recaptcha Plugin integrates reCAPTCHA antispam methods with WordPress including comment, registration, and email spam protection and is available at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-recaptcha/.

This advisory describes multiple Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities and one Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability on the plugin.  As a result, an attacker can gain elevated access privileges to sensitive page content, session cookies, and a variety of other information maintained by the browser on behalf of the WordPress administrator user. Furthermore, the attacker can perform actions administrative privileges.

Affected Components
This problem was confirmed in the latest version of the plugin – WP-reCAPTCHA 2.9.8.2, other versions maybe also affected.

CVSS Scoring System
Conviso calculated the scores using the online CVSS calculator found at http://www.patchadvisor.com/PatchAdvisor/CVSSCalculator.aspx and described at http://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-guide.pdf.

The CVSS score is: 6.4

Base Score: 6.7
Temporal Score: 6.4
We used the following values to calculate the scores:

Base score is: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N
Temporal score is: E:F/RL:U/RC:C
Details
The plugin’s configuration page is vulnerable to Stored Cross Site Scripting. Several fields are received through POST and included on the response page with inadequate sanitization. The vulnerable code is shown bellow:

749: <input name=”recaptcha_opt_pubkey” id=”recaptcha_opt_pubkey” size=”40″

value=”<?php echo $optionarray_def['pubkey']; ?>” />

753: <input name=”recaptcha_opt_privkey” id=”recaptcha_opt_privkey” size=”40″

value=”<?php echo $optionarray_def['privkey']; ?>” />

782: <input name=”re_tabindex” id=”re_tabindex” size=”5″ value=”<?php echo

$optionarray_def['re_tabindex']; ?>” />

814: <input name=”error_blank” id=”error_blank” size=”80″ value=”<?php

echo $optionarray_

def['error_blank']; ?>” />

818: <input name=”error_incorrect” id=”error_incorrect” size=”80″ value=”<?php

echo $optionarray_def['error_incorrect']; ?>” />

865: <input name=”mailhide_pub” id=”mailhide_pub” size=”40″ value=”<?php echo

$optionarray_def['mailhide_pub']; ?>” />

869: <input name=”mailhide_priv” id=”mailhide_priv” size=”40″ value=”<?php echo

$optionarray_def['mailhide_priv']; ?>” />

888: <input name=”mh_replace_link” id=”mh_replace_link” size=”40″ value=”<?php

echo $optionarray_def['mh_replace_link']; ?>” />

891: <input name=”mh_replace_title” id=”mh_replace_title” size=”40″ value=”<?php

echo $optionarray_def['mh_replace_title']; ?>” />

As a result, an attacker may insert HTML/JavaScript commands to be interpreted in the session of an authenticated administrator and, as the plugin’s configuration page is not protected against Cross Site Request Forgery, the exploitation can be used to inject configuration values and change the reCAPTCHA configuration, disabling CAPTCHA for comments and registration forms. Proof of concept exploitation code is available to interested parties.

Issue Mitigation
The developer did not provided a patch or workaround. The solution for this issue should add code to sanitize the values before including them using the htmlspecialchars() function or equivalent. Furthermore, a mechanism to protect against the CSRF is needed to prevent an attacker from changing the plugin’s configuration.

Additional Information
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CVE-2011-0759 to this issue.
