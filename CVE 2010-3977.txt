Security Advisory

1. Issue Description
Created and distributed by Delicious Days (http://www.deliciousdays.com/), cforms is a rich form plugin for WordPress, offering deployment of multiple Ajax driven contact forms throughout user’s blog or even on the same page. An issue on version 11.5 allows the exploit of a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability and the consequent capability of client-side attacks for data leaking and malware propagation.

2. Affected Components
File lib_ajax.php on version 11.5.

3. Details
The file lib_ajax.php on version 11.5 creates a data array with all values inserted on the form’s fields on a POST requisition. As there is no data validation of the rs and rsargs parameters, it is possible to inject malformed data by Javascript.
