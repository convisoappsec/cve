Security Advisory

1. Issue Description
This advisory describes a vulnerability in the permission of the directory RealMedia created as default during the installation of Open AdStream, an ad campaign management platform provided by 24/7 Real Media, which exposes directly to the Internet the configuration files, including .sql which contains access credentials.

As a result, a cracker can use this flaw to install a backdoor or take the ownership of the affected component as he/she had access to all configuration files and access credentials.

2. Affected Components
The vulnerability was identified on the deployment of Open AdStream Version 5.7 in several large Brazilian Internet portals and media delivery websites. The product’s webpage is located at http://www.247realmedia.com/EN-US/us/open-ad-stream.html.

This version of the product can be used only with MySQL 3.23 and Apache 1.36.x, versions which are outdated and vulnerable to several exploits as described on the security advisories posted on the Internet at http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/11357 and http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_13.html.

The vulnerability described in this advisory can easily be found by “script kid” style hackers, making non-targeted attacks, by searching Google using “Google Hacking” techniques.

3. Details
The deployment process performed by 24/7 Real Media keeps the default configuration on Open AdStream which publishes the configuration files of the host exposed to the Internet on a format such as http://admXX.customername.com.br/RealMedia. As a result the following example files can be fully accessed:

The database server location as well as access credentials of administrative accounts can be found within the files oasis_mysql_insertuser.sql and oasis_params.cfg. With this information, an attacker could gain access to the database and perform any malicious activity. Other files such as oasis_install.ini and install.sh discloses the directory organization of Open AdStream server, which could be useful in combination with another attack.

Other problem we found is related to the old versions of Apache HTTP server and MySQL that must be installed to use the affected software.

Apache Foundation released the final release of version 1.3 of the Apache HTTP Server on February 3rd 2010, stating that no more full releases will be produced, although critical security updates may be made available as described on their mailing lists archives at http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-announce/201002.mbox/%3C20100203000334.GA19021@infiltrator.stdlib.net%3E. They recommend that users update to the current 2.2 version.

4. Issue Mitigation
The permission of the directory RealMedia should be changed in order to deny access to the configuration files.
