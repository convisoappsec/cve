  3. *Vulnerability Description*

    

      Spree Commerce [1] is "a 100% open source e-commerce platform powered by the popular Ruby on Rails framework. It was designed to make customization and upgrades as simple as possible". Multiple Unsafe Reflection [2] vulnerabilities have been found on it that affected any version >= 1.0.0.
    

  
  
  4. *Vulnerable packages*

    

      

        
   . Spree Commerce >= 1.0.0
      


    

  
  
  5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

    

      

      


    

  
  
  6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

    

      A safe way to use the String#constantize method is to apply a whitelist check over the string
      before the call to ensure that an allowed class/module will be constantized.

      The vendor has provided patches that fix the flaws. [4]
    

  
  
  7. *Credits*

    

      This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Gabriel Quadros. 
      The publication of this advisory was coordinated by Gabriel Quadros.
    

  
  
  8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

    

      Unsafe Reflection vulnerabilities occur in Rails generally when the one of the following methods is called with
      user-controlled data: String#constantize, String#safe_constantize, Module#const_get, Module#qualified_const_get. [2][3]
      These methods take a string and try to find a constant with the name specified. When this occurs,
      then the attacker can change the application control flow in ways not intended by the developer. This can lead to several
      forms of attack, such as enumeration of classes and methods, enumeration of files and directories and command injection.
      
      Four occurrences of this vulnerability were found in the Spree source code, within the administrator interface.
      Below you can see the vulnerable pieces of code obtained from Spree 1.3.2:

      File: core/app/controllers/spree/admin/payment_methods_controller.rb        
      

/-----
      10    @payment_method = params[:payment_method].delete(:type).constantize.new(params[:payment_method]) 
      
-----/


      File: promo/app/controllers/spree/admin/promotion_actions_controller.rb
      

/-----
      5     @promotion_action = params[:action_type].constantize.new(params[:promotion_action])
      
-----/


      File: promo/app/controllers/spree/admin/promotion_rules_controller.rb
      

/-----
      9     promotion_rule_type = params[:promotion_rule].delete(:type)
      10    @promotion_rule = promotion_rule_type.constantize.new(params[:promotion_rule])
      
-----/


      File: promo/app/controllers/spree/admin/promotions_controller.rb
      

/-----
      10    calculator_type = params[:promotion].delete(:calculator_type)
      11    @promotion = Promotion.new(params[:promotion])
      12    if calculator_type
      13    @promotion.calculator = calculator_type.constantize.new
      
-----/


      A Proof of Concept demonstrating command injection for the second occurrence is shown below:
