Security Advisory

Issue Description
The WordPress Related Posts Plugin, available at http://WordPress.org/extend/plugins/wp-related-posts/ shows the posts related to others posts. This advisory describes multiple Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities and one Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability on  the plugin.

As a result, an attacker can gain elevated access privileges to sensitive page content, session cookies, and a variety of other information maintained by the web browser on behalf of the WordPress administrator. Furthermore, the attacker can perform actions with administrative privileges.

Affected Components
This problem was confirmed in the latest version of the plugin – WP Related Posts 1.0, other versions maybe also affected.

CVSS Scoring System
Conviso calculated the scores using the online CVSS calculator found at http://www.patchadvisor.com/PatchAdvisor/CVSSCalculator.aspx and described at http://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-guide.pdf.

The CVSS score is: 6.4

Base Score: 6.7
Temporal Score: 6.4
We used the following values to calculate the scores:

Base score is: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N
Temporal score is: E:F/RL:U/RC:C
Details

The plugin’s configuration page is vulnerable to Stored Cross Site Scripting. The three fields wp_relatedposts_ title, wp_relatedposts_num and wp_relatedposts_type are received through POST or GET and included on the response page with inadequate sanitization. The vulnerable code is shown bellow:

158: <tr valign=”top”>

159:        <th scope=”row”>Title:</th>

160:                        <td><input type=”text”

name=”wp_relatedposts_title” value=”<?=$options['

title']?>”></td>

161: </tr>

162: <tr valign=”top”>

163:        <th scope=”row”>Number posts:</th>

164:                        <td><input type=”text”

name=”wp_relatedposts_num” value=”<?=$options['

count']?>”></td>

165: </tr>

166: <tr valign=”top”>

167:        <th scope=”row”>Related on:</th>

168:                        <td>

169:                                        <select name=”wp_relatedposts_type”>

170:                                                        <option

selected value=”<?=$options['type']?>”><?=$options['type']?></option>

171:                                                        <option

value=”Tags”>Tags</option>

172:                                                        <option

value=”Category”>Category</option>

173:                                                        </select>

174:                        </td>

Another vulnerable piece of code is the one which prints the related posts list. The title, eceived through the parameter wp_relatedposts_title, is included with little sanitization into suchs lists. The vulnerable code is shown bellow:

79: $relatedpost.= ‘<br><br><br><h3>’ . $options['title'] . ‘</h3><ul>’;

(…)

120: $relatedpost.= ‘<br><br><br><h3>’ . $options['title'] . ‘</h3><ul>’;

These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to insert HTML/JavaScript commands to be interpreted in the session of an authenticated administrator. Since the plugin’s configuration page is not protected against Cross Site Request Forgery, the exploitation permits the attacker to inject configuration values. Proof of concept exploitation code is available to interested parties.

Issue Mitigation
The developers have not provided a patch or workaround. The solution should add code to sanitize the values before including them using the htmlspecialchars() function or equivalent. Furthermore, a mechanism to protect against the CSRF is needed to prevent an attacker from changing the plugin’s configuration.

Additional Information
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CVE-2011-0760 to this issue.
